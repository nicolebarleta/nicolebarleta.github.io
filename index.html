  <h1><span>The Graphic Artist</span></h1>
  <p>
  She is a wonderful daughter and a good friend to all of us, her loving personality is what made me appreciate her creativity even more.
  Her talent in creating artworks amazes me; approximately it will only take her 5 - 10 minutes to draw someone's face into an anime character.
  And in video making, she can shoot and edit a video in one day. This page will show some artworks and videos that she produced. And also some snippets of her life as a cat mom.

<span class="tigger">Tigger</span> and <span class="elsa">Elsa</span><br>
</h4>

<p>
  I've never seen anyone so dedicated to taking care of their cats as Alex.<br>
  The way she loves <span class="tigger">Tigger</span> and <span class="elsa">Elsa</span> is so infectious.
  People around her learned to love these little animals as well. She adopted Tigger back in 2013 when she was a college student.
  She had him since she was a kitten and they have always had a strong bond. The newest addition to her family is Elsa, the white cat.
  She adopted Elsa shortly after her birthday in March of this year!
  She always loves to take photos of them and share her adventures with her little cat family.

<h3>Message from Alex's mom</h3>
<p>
  <span class="elsa">Preciosa</span>, you know what happened yesterday when you sent me the photo of your kittens,
  my love for animals became so beautiful because they are little animals and look at that love they have.<br><br>
  You know even though I shouldn't say it because they are not your children but all that love is the one I feel that you give to me, you always think of me, you know what I like,
  you listen to me when I feel sad, I know I can trust you in everything.<br><br>
  And I know that you are a good daughter, a great companion, and a wonderful friend
  because I know that you like helping people who needs you.<br><br>
  <span class="elsa">Te amo y te quiero tanto mi hijita hermosa</span>, I know I don't have to tell you because you know it but I tell you the same.<br><br>
  May you spend a beautiful day, and may God take care of you and protect you, I always love you very much.<br><br>
  <span class="mom">Love, Mom <i class="fa fa-heart-o" style="font-size:48px;color:#fa8687"></i></span>
